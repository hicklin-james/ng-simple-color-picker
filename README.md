# ng-simple-color-picker

Sometimes you don't need or want a full colorpicker in your web application. This directive creates a simple bootstrap that allows you to select from a pre-defined list of colors.

### Dependencies

1. Bootstrap css (tested with 3.3.7)
2. Angular bootstrap (tested with 2.5.0)
3. Angular (tested with 1.4.0)

No guarantees that this directive will work on other (especially older) versions of the dependencies. Note that **jQuery is not required**.

### Installation

#### Bower
```
bower install ng-simple-color-picker
```

#### Custom
If you don't use bower, you can clone the repository and include the JS and CSS files in the `dist` directory of the root folder.
